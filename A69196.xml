            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>The Peace of Reconciliation, is the Peace between God and man. This is the foundation of all true comforts, and the head of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, whence all the other kindes of Peace doe ſpring. When <hi>Adam</hi> did eate the forbidden fruite hee loſt his fauour and Peace with God,<note place="margin">Et Deum &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem perdidit. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                        </note> and his flying from the face of God was an euident argument of the breach of that Peace.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:21074:10"/>
                     <p>This was a miſerable condition; for better it were to be at varience with all the world, then to be at oddes with God. <hi>Horrendum eſt:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10.31.</note> It is a fearefull thing, ſaith the Apoſtle, to fall into the hands of the liuing God.

                     </p>
                     <p>By how much therefore this warre and varience is wofull, by ſo much more is the reconciliation comfortable. Therefore the Lord doth not onely ingeminate the ioy of this newes, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 40.1. ſaying, <hi>Comfort you, comfort you my people.</hi> But bids his ſeruants bring forth this Cordiall,<note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> and ſpeake <hi>to the heart of Hieruſalem, and cry vnto her, that her warfare is ended.</hi> As it was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full newes to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> butler,<note place="margin">Gen. 40.13.</note> that the King his maſters fauour ſhould be recouered, and himſelfe reſtored to his office: So muſt it needes be a ſingular comfort to all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

                     <p>Now this Peace of reconciliation, brings in the next linke, the peace of Conſcience, which I call the peace of Conſolation: For when this happy newes is brought home to the heart, that Gods iuſtice is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and his wrath pacifyed; then haue we Peace and ioy in the holy-Ghoſt.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note>

                     <p>The holy-Ghoſt is a bleſſed Peace-maker: for Peace is one of thoſe excellent fruits of the Spirit mentioned <hi>Gal</hi> 5.22.

                     <p>Some employ themſelues in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king peace betweene God and man.

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 106.23,</note> So <hi>Noah</hi> by his ſacrifice procured a couenant of Peace, at the hands of the Lord, and ſtopt the fountaines of the deepe,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.21.</note> and the flood-gates of heauen, that the earth ſhould no more be made a fiſh-poole by the invndation of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21074:51"/> Phraſe is thus vſed. And I will onely pitch vpon one chapter, that is, the firſt of <hi>Luke.</hi> In the 76. verſe it is ſaid of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, that he <hi>ſhould be called the Prophet of the moſt high.</hi> And was he not ſo? Yes euen by the atteſtation of our Sauiour Chriſt he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.9.</note> &amp; more then a Prophet. Againe the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in the 48. verſe ſaith, <hi>From henceforth all generations ſhall call me bleſſed.</hi> And that this is not a bare title conferred vpon her, the womans acclamation can witneſſe in the elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth of <hi>Luke:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 11.27.</note> 
                        <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the Pappes which thou haſt ſucked.</hi> Yea ſhe ſhall be honoured as the moſt bleſſed amongſt women to the end of the world. Againe in the 35. verſe the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt ſhall be called the Son of God. And that Chriſt was ſo,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Peter</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed worthily in the time of his life; the <hi>Centurion</hi> witneſſed notably at the time of his death:<note place="margin">Mat. 26.54.</note> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> that by his reſurrection he was mightily declared to be the Sonne of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21074:51"/> God. Thus as <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt was called a Prophet, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was called bleſſed, and Chriſt was called the Sonne of God, <hi>that is,</hi> they not onely were ſo, but were acknowledged and publiſhed ſo to be: So ſhall the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers be called the children of God. For he that will not ſuffer a hayre to fall from the head of his ſeruants without his diuine prouidence, will not ſuffer their graces &amp; endowments to vaniſh and periſh in ſilence. Albeit they may be compaſſed about for a time with the clowds of obſcurity, yet ſhall their worth breake forth like the light,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.6.</note> and be publiſhed to the world with a clowde of witneſſes.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> Thus did the diuine prouidence diſpoſe moſt fitly of our Sauiors paſſion; both for the Time, Place, and manner of his Death. For the Time and Place,<note place="margin">The Paſſouer.</note> It was at the great feſtiuitie held at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> which yeelded a confluence of many nations to that City, which was then the onely Metropolis of Religion thorow the world: And for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21074:52"/> the manner of it likewiſe: For he was lifted vp,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.14.</note> like the braſen Serpent, vpon a high croſſe vpon a conſpicuous Mountaine,<note place="margin">In Praefatione ad librum de ſeptem verbis.</note> &amp; that with all his parts ſtretched out ſeuerally, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath lately &amp; largely ſhewed. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription alſo was in Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, that by the Croſſe, the Time, the Place, the Nations and Languages, the happie newes of our redemption, by the death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Ieſus Chriſt, might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearſed, as it were by many riuers, throughout the world.

But their ſubordinat free concealment, became an eſpeciall meanes of publication of his glorious triumph ouer death.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.15.</note>

Theſe ſonnes of Peace are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out in a moſt eſpeciall manner. They are like the Sunne in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the eye in the Head, and the heart in the Body, the nobleſt and worthieſt of all the children of God, And this their worth ſhall bee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the world.

And this monſtrous ſinne is like the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty windes which beating on the foure corners of the houſe wherein <hi>Iobs</hi> children were, did caſt it on their heads<note n="ſ" place="margin">Iob. 1.19.</note>: for when ſin once breathes, and blowes from theſe foure Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, it drawes downe the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God vpon the ſinners heads, to their euerlaſting ruin.<note n="t" place="margin">Leuit. 11.20.</note> And as the Fowles that went on all foure, being vncleane, were abhomination

But to the end that the nature and danger of this ſinne may the better appeare, let vs conſider why it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. Where firſt we muſt obſerue, that it is ſo called, not, becauſe it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the perſon, but againſt the attributes, and eſpeciall operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Ghoſt. The old and vulgar diſtinction of the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doth illuſtrate this very well. The Father is called Power, againſt him therefore men are ſaid to ſinne in weakeneſſe, and infirmitie. The Sonne is called Wiſedome, againſt him they offend of ignorance and ſimplicitie. The holy Ghoſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Grace, againſt him therefore they ſinne who tranſgreſſe wilfully and maliciouſly; It being then the proper

For as the yron which was made ſoft by being in the fire, when it is taken forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth harder then euer it was. So the heart of man, which with the fire of Gods ſpirit, was in ſome ſort mollified and made to melt, when the ſame ſpirit is vtterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne, becomes extreamely obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and incorrigible.<note n="v" place="margin">Dan. 9.9.</note>

If they treade vnderfoote of a baſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation the Sonne of God, and the blood of the Teſtament, is it not a iuſt recompence, that Sathan ſhould trample them vnder his feete in the place of torments?

                     <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe<note n="h" place="margin">Bellam. de poenitent. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>16.</hi>
                        </note> hath diuers arguments for the confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this errour, which I will briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeate.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:21074:86"/>1. The ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt is properly blaſphemie, but finall impenitency is not blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; therefore finall impenitency is not the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Finall impenitency is not committed till death, but the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt is committed before death: therefore finall impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency is not the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt; The <hi>minor</hi> propoſition is euident, for our Sauiour charged the Phariſees with this ſinne, who were then liuing, and for any thing we know, liued long after.</p>
                     <p>Further, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of this ſinne in the ſixt to the Hebrewes, ſaith, it is impoſſible that they which haue committed the ſame ſhould be renewed by repentance. In which words the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of thoſe that are aliue, elſe ſhould he affirme that the dead cannot be renewed by repentance, which ſpeech were idle
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21074:86"/> and much vnbeſeeming ſo great an Apoſtle. Againe, whereas Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, there is a ſin vnto death, I ſay not <hi>that thou ſhouldſt pray for it;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.16.</note> he ſpeaks of liuing men. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſome thinke he ſpeakes of the dead, the Text is directly againſt them. For he ſaith, <hi>he that knoweth his brother to ſinne a ſinne not vnto death, &amp;c.</hi> in which words hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth that a man may ſee and know when the ſinne is committed, and therefore he ſpeaketh not of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall impenitencie, which cannot be knowne till after a mans death, and hardly then alſo. Moreouer if hee ſpake of the ſinnes of thoſe that are dead, hee ſhould not ſay, <hi>He that knowes his brother to ſinne; but he that knowes his brother to haue ſinned.</hi>

                     <p>To theſe places <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> doe anſwere, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apoſtle ſaith, hee cannot be <hi>renewed by Repentance, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines no more ſacrifice for ſinne,</hi> he is thus to be vnderſtood, hee cannot haue the benefit of a ſecond Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.

So that

Laſtly, ſuppoſe the Apoſtles words were ſo to be taken, as that he ſhould therein denie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Baptiſme to the ſinner, doth not the ſame imply a deniall of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?

                     <p>And here by the way (beloued) let me giue you a caueat. Foraſmuch as this ſinne doth depend vpon ſuch difficult circumſtances, the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie gift of diſcerning the ſpirits being<note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.10.</note> aboliſhed, it is very hard

                        </note> inſpiration, to diſcerne this ſinne in others, and very dangerous to charge any with the ſame. Therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you ſee ſome ſinne very deſperately, yet take heede, you ſtep not haſtily into Gods throne, but rather erect a tribunall in your owne hearts, and iudge your ſelues, as the Apoſtle exhorts,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31.</note> doe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly ſhoote forth the darts of your cenſures againſt others, nor vncharitably deny them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your prayers. <hi>Caietans</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ſpeech doth much affect<note n="b" place="margin">Caietan. in Epiſt. <hi>1</hi> Iohn.</note> me.

                     <p>Secondly, here is matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. For, ſeeing this ſinne is ſo dreadfull, wee ſhould be very carefull and fearefull, leſt we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame.

The curing of the wound was more grieuous, then the wound it ſelfe:</hi> yet if there were any hope of cure, it were ſomewhat tolerable, but when all the balme in Gilead cannot cure it, it is moſt lamentable. It is a point of wiſdome to preuent corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſeaſes that are mortall, and it is much more neceſſary to preuent the ſpirituall. And as for the better
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21074:102"/> preuention of ſickneſſe, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of health, diuers hurtfull meates are to be ſhunned, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wholeſome meanes to be vſed: ſo for the preuenting of this mortall diſeaſe, and preſeruing the ſoule in ſpirituall health, diuers euill courſes are to be carefully auoided, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Chriſtian duties to be diligently practiſed.</p>

                        <hi>and the God of all conſolation; He is rich in mercy. He hath mercy for thouſands.

                        <hi>Thou haſt not told vs the one halfe.</hi> Behold, ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant are the mercies of our God, and therefore, poore ſinners neede not come to this bleſſed fountaine, like the people to the poole of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda, one at once, but be they as many as the ſtarres in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the ſands on the ſea-ſhore, let them approch together to the Mercy-ſeate and they ſhall finde, that God hath in readineſſe a mercy for euery miſery, as it were a preſent ſalue for euery ſore. The Lord kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a continuall Iubilee; his Court of Chancery ſtandeth alwaies open; his euer-flowing and ouer-flowing

                     <p>Againe, as Gods mercies are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the <hi>diſcreete,</hi> ſo are they great <hi>in the continued quantity: Yea they are exceeding great,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14.
